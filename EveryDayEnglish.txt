Night gathers,And now my watch begins.It shall not end Until my death.I shall take my wife,hold on lands,father no children.I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.I shall live and die at my post.I am the sword in the darkness.I am the watcher on the walls.I am the fire that burns against the cold,the light that bring the dawn,the guards the realms if men.I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,for this night and all the nights to come.
长夜将至，我从今开始守望，至死方休。我将不娶妻、不封地、不生子。我将不戴宝冠，不争荣宠。我将尽忠职守，生死于斯。我是黑暗中的利剑，长城上的守卫，抵御寒冷的烈焰，破晓时分的光线，唤醒眠者的号角，守护王国的坚盾。我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人，今夜如此，夜夜皆然。
